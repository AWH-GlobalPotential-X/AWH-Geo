# AWH-Geo
AWH-Geo tool and calculations for the paper Global Potential of Harvesting Drinking Water from Air using Solar Energy.

This tool was built at X (formerly Google X) for a product design requirement assessment and market analysis for a novel portable water-from-air device (atmospheric water generator) for supplying drinking water needs to the 2.2 billion worldwide without access. Understanding the output in L/day of a modeled device is critical for product design iteration to drive down costs per unit water and increase adoption. 

The tool uses a global climate timeseries at high spatio-temporal resolution (ERA5-Land at 9 km, 1-hr interval) over the five-year period 2013-2018. Other climate data could be substituted if desired by the user. 

There are four main components to the tool available here, with descriptions below:
